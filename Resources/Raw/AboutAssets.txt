Any raw assets you want to be deployed with your application can be placed in
this directory (and child directories). Deployment of the asset to your application
is automatically handled by the following `MauiAsset` Build Action within your `.csproj`.

    <MauiAsset Include="Resources\Raw\**" LogicalName="%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)" />



    async Task LoadMauiAsset()
    {
        using var stream = await FileSystem.OpenAppPackageFileAsync("AboutAssets.txt");
        using var reader = new StreamReader(stream);

        var contents = reader.ReadToEnd();
    }
